\section{Introduction}
Scientific progress often relies on the clear presentation of ideas, methods, and evidence. The introduction should provide background information, explain the relevance of the research problem, and state the specific objectives of the work \cite{lamport1994latex}.

It is recommended to begin broadly and narrow down to the preciseresearch question or hypothesis being tested. Relevant literature should be cited to position the contribution within the field.
