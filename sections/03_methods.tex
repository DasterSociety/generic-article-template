\section{Materials and Methods}
This section describes the experimental setup, materials, and analytical methods used in the study. The goal is to ensure  reproducibility and transparency.

You may include formulas, equations, and figures to illustrate your setup or workflow, for example:

\begin{equation}
	v = \frac{d}{t}
\end{equation}

where \( v \) represents velocity, \( d \) is the measured distance, and \( t \) is the elapsed time.
