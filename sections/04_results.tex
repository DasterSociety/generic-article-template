\section{Results}
Present the results clearly and objectively. Figures and tables should be referenced in the text and accompanied by concise captions.

Example:

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/example.png}
	\caption{Example result showing measured signal response over time.}
	\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

Discuss any relevant trends, observations, or anomalies. Avoid extensive interpretation here; that belongs in the Discussion section.
